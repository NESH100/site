**multiRegionFoam** is a modular, extensible simulation framework designed for
solving coupled multiphysics problems involving multiple interacting regions.
Built on top of OpenFOAM, it unifies solid, fluid, and interface physics into a
single consistent solver architectureâ€”allowing engineers and researchers to
model complex thermal, fluid, chemical, and electrochemical systems with ease
and precision.

The framework supports both monolithic and partitioned coupling approaches,
enabling robust and efficient simulation of conjugate heat transfer, multiphase
flows with deformable interfaces, compressible-incompressible interactions, and
even electrochemical transport in applications such as fuel cells and batteries.
With clear region-level separation, reusable physics models, and full automation
support through Python APIs, multiRegionFoam makes it easy to configure and run
highly customized multiphysics cases at scale.

Whether validating fundamental physical phenomena or building industrial-scale
workflows, this solver infrastructure is designed to streamline development,
reduce boilerplate, and maintain solver consistency across a wide range of
physical domains. The examples presented in this documentation illustrate the
breadth and capability of the framework across canonical and real-world
applications.

Explore the use cases, learn how to set up region-coupled simulations, and start
building your own multiphysics models with confidence.

<!-- Goldydocs provides a single web UI providing
visibility into porridge temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics! You
can even find out who's been eating **your** porridge.

(Sadly, Goldydocs isn't a real project, but you can use this site as an example
to create your own real websites with [Docsy](https://docsy.dev))
